        At Better HPC, we build software that empowers HPC environments to operate
        efficiently and reliably. Our solutions streamline complex workflows, automate repetitive tasks,
        and address the daily operational challenges faced by HPC administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        By focusing on robust, quality driven tools, we help HPC centers reduce operational friction,
        optimize resource utilization, and deliver consistent, reproducible results to researchers and
        engineers alike. Every product we build is grounded in real-world operational needs and designed
        to simplify management at scale.
